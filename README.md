# Soma

Soma is a simple PDF viewer extension for Visual Studio Code. It allows you to quickly open and view .pdf documents within your editor.

Install it here: ![Soma](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brian-njogu.soma)

## Features

Open multiple pdfs via the command panel by typing `Somesha`.

![Soma Demo](https://github.com/liltrendi/Soma/blob/main/assets/demo.gif?raw=true)

Navigate through pages using the Arrow keys (`Left` for previous pages, `Right` for next pages).

> This was created as a quick easy means to open multiple pdfs, and by no means replaces extensions like vscode-pdf.

## Install

Open VSCode and type `Cmd+P` (or `Ctrl+P` on Windows), then type `ext install brian-njogu.soma`. Alternatively, you can install it from the Extensions Marketplace by searching for `Soma`.
